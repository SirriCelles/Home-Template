To view this template well, change your aspect ratio to 1440 x 700.
This is so because it hasn't been optimized for responsiveness.

In order to view in 1440 x 700 aspect ratio, right click in your browser and click inspect page, click "Toggle device toolbar".
in the uppermost panel, click the drop down and click edit. Click "add custum devices". look for "Laptop with HiDPI Screen".
